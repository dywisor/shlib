shlib - shell module library


shlib, the *shell module library*, is a project that aims to provide reusable
shell code in modular form, thus allowing to create small scripts as well as
big library files.

Its features range from basic functions like *die()* known from Perl,
generic iterators, file system manipulation and colored messages to more
complex functionality such as squashfs containers and initramfs code, including
*liram*, a distribution-agnostic approach to load a (Linux) system into tmpfs.

See doc/shlib.rst for documentation.
