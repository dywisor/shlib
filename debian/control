Description: shell module library files
 shlib, the shell module library, is a project that aims to provide reusable
 shell code in modular form, thus allowing to create small scripts as well as
 big library files.
 .
 Its features range from basic functions like die() known from Perl,
 generic iterators, file system manipulation and colored messages to more
 complex functionality such as squashfs containers and initramfs code, including
 liram, a distribution-agnostic approach to load a (Linux) system into tmpfs.
 .
 This package contains the module files.
