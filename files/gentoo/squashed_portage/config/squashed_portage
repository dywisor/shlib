# /etc/conf.d/squashed_portage
#
#  squashed_portage main config file
#
#
# NOTE:
#   Mounting more than one squashed portage tree is possible.
#   Simply copy /etc/conf.d/squashed_portage.example to
#   /etc/conf.d/squashed_portage.<name> and symlink
#   /etc/init.d/squashed_portage accordingly.
#
#   Then, define global variables like AUFS_ROOT etc. here
#   and tree-specific variables (usually PORTAGE_NAME and PORTAGE_MP)
#   in the copied config file.
#

# tree image dir
#
#  This is the (persistent) directory where
#  squashfs files will be stored to / loaded from.
#
#  Defaults to "/var/cache/portage".
#
#PORTAGE_SFS_IMAGE_DIR="/var/cache/portage"

# save on stop
#
#  Whether to reate an image of the portage tree
#  when stopping ("YES") or not ("NO").
#
#  Note that this won't check whether the current tree is newer
#  than what's already on disk (i.e., in PORTAGE_SFS_IMAGE_DIR).
#
#  Uses the "save_today" command, so only one image will be created per day.
#
#  Defaults to "NO".
#
#PORTAGE_SFS_SAVE_ON_STOP="YES"

# default tmpfs size
#
#  Size in MiB that will available for writing to a portage tree.
#
#  Defaults to "500".
#
#PORTAGE_SFS_MEM_SIZE_DEFAULT="500"

# size of the squashfs file container
#
#  Total size in MiB that will be available for storing *all* squashfs
#  files in memory (tmpfs).
#  A value less than zero results in not mounting any tmpfs,
#  thus it's possible to use "normal" directories as container.
#
#  Defaults to "500".
#
#PORTAGE_SFS_CONTAINER_SIZE="500"

# aufs root
#
#  Root directory for auxiliary mounts, e.g. tmpfs and squashfs files.
#
#  Defaults to "/aufs/portage".
#
#PORTAGE_SFS_AUFS_ROOT="/aufs/portage"


# IMPORTANT:
#  The following variables are included here for reference only, but
#  should to be set in tree-specific config files (squashed_portage.<name>),
#  and *not* in this file.
#

# name of the portage tree
#
#  Used to locate the squashfs file
#   ${PORTAGE_SFS_IMAGE_DIR}/${PORTAGE_SFS_NAME}.sfs
#
#  Defaults to <name> or "gentoo".
#
#PORTAGE_NAME="gentoo"

# portage mountpoint
#
#  Directory where the writable tree will be mounted.
#
#  Defaults to "/usr/portage" if $PORTAGE_NAME is "gentoo",
#  else "/var/portage/tree/${PORTAGE_NAME}".
#
#PORTAGE_MP="/usr/portage"
