# Path to the script that will actually pack your system.
# This can also be a name if the pack script is in PATH.
PACK_SCRIPT="/usr/bin/liram-packscript"

# Name of the boot slot. The boot slot has to be a symlink, if it exists.
#
# Defaults to "current".
#
#LIRAM_BOOT_SLOT=""

# Slot (name) that will be used to fix up the boot slot link.
# Optional.
#LIRAM_FALLBACK_SLOT=""

# Directory that contains all slots. The path should be relative to
# the mountpoint of the liram disk.
LIRAM_IMAGE_ROOT="images"

# Directory that contains "core" images (typically host-generated files).
# The path is interpreted as relative to LIRAM_IMAGE_ROOT if it does not
# start with a "/", relative to the mountpoint of the liram disk if it
# starts with a single "/", and absolute if it starts with more than one
# "/" char. Note that the "//*" variant is not supported.
LIRAM_CORE_IMAGE_DIR="core/default"

# Use hardlinks to add files from LIRAM_CORE_IMAGE_DIR (if set to y),
# else use symlinks. Defaults to "y". Using hardlinks allows to set
# LIRAM_CORE_IMAGE_DIR = %LIRAM_BOOT_SLOT, but it'll be harder to track
# which image files have been created specifically for a given slot.
#
# Defaults to "y".
#
LIRAM_HARDLINK_CORE="y"

# identifier of the disk that is used to store the images.
# Should be any of
# * UUID=<uuid>
# * LABEL=<label>
# * /dev/sd?, ...
#
# Note that this option is *ignored* on systems that booted with liram,
# as /LIRAM_ENV contains LIRAM_DISK and is read after this file.
#
#LIRAM_DISK=""

# mountpoint for LIRAM_DISK
#
# Defaults to "/mnt/liram/sysdisk".
#
#LIRAM_DISK_MP=""

# disk that contains kernel images, initramfs, etc.
#
# *** not used so far / reserved for future usage ***
#
#LIRAM_BOOTDISK=""

# mountpoint for LIRAM_BOOTDISK
#
# Defaults to "/mnt/liram/boot".
#
#LIRAM_BOOTDISK_MP=""

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Options better left unchanged:
#

# image slot that will be used for packing
#
# Do *not* change this if unsure.
#
# Defaults to $DATE_NOW (which is $(date +%F)).
#
#LIRAM_SLOT=""

# directory for filesystem locks
#
# Defaults to "/run/lock/liram".
#
#PACK_LOCKDIR=""

# fine-tuning for filesystem locks
#LOCKFILE_ACQUIRE_RETRY="10"
#LOCKFILE_ACQUIRE_WAIT_INTVL="0.5"
